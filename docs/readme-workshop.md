# Workshop Guide To Deploy AI Models on Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI)

## Overview

1. Deploy a generative AI model with serving endpoint

1. Create and use a workbench with the deployed inference server

1. QnA with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

1. Agentic AI and MCP Servers

1. Monitor the deployed model

### Prerequisites for environment 

An OpenShift cluster that have OpenShift AI with Nvidia GPU. 
- For Red Hatters, provision a demo environment from the demo catalog, ie. RHOAI on OCP on AWS with NVIDIA GPUs. 
- For attendees, this is already setup for you.

## Purpose

The purpose for this guide is to offer the simplest steps for deploying a **privately hosted AI model** on Red Hat Openshift AI. This guide will be covering deploying a Red Hat certified ***Qwen3 Model*** using the ***vLLM ServingRuntime for KServe*** on ***NVIDIA GPU***. In addition to deploying the model, we will showcase a simple observability stack so that you can collect and visualize metrics related to AI model performance and GPU information.

## 1. Deploying Model on Red Hat OpenShift AI

### 1.1 Create a workspace
Login to your environment. If you're in a workshop, [follow the link to the portal from your host](). 

1. Go to Data Science Projects and create a project. This will be your workspace where you manage workbenches, models, pipelines, storage connections.

### 1.2 Use a pre-built LLM container
Using a pre-built modelcar container with LLM makes deployment faster. This is the easiest way to get a LLM model running on Red Hat OpenShift AI. Since the model is pre-packaged, it does not need to download from HuggingFace, you can deploy this in an air-gapped environment!

1. Navigate to https://quay.io/repository/redhat-ai-services/modelcar-catalog and explore the available models.
![Image](../img/03/3.1.0.png)
1. Select a containerized model you want to use. In this example, we will use qwen3-4b.

1. Click the download/save button to reveal the tags, select any of the tag to reveal the URI.
![Image](../img/03/3.1.0-1.png)

    ![Image](../img/03/3.1.3.png)
1. Copy the URL from quay.io onwards.

1. Next, deploy the model by navigating to the Models tab in your workspace on Red Hat Openshift AI. Go to the Models tab within your Data Science Project and select single-model serving:
![Image](../img/04/4.3.png)

<!-- ***Note that once you select single or multi model serving, you are unable to change it without going into the openshift console and changing the value of the `modelmesh-enabled` tag on the namespace, true means multi model serving is enabled, false means single model serving is enabled. You can remove the tag entirely from the namespace if you want the option to select between the UI like you were able to in this step*** -->
  
6. Fill in a name, ensure to choose nvidia gpu serving runtime and deployment mode to **Standard**.
![Image](../img/03/3.1.1.png)
1. Remember to check the box to secure the LLM model endpoint that you are about to deploy.
![Image](../img/03/3.1.1-2.png)
1. Select connection type *URI - v1* and give it a name. A good practice is to name it the model you are about to deploy.
1. Next, append the URI with **oci://**
![Image](../img/03/3.1.2.png)

    ```
    oci://quay.io/redhat-ai-services/modelcar-catalog:qwen3-4b
    ```

    >Note: If you face resource problems, try select a smaller model. For example qwen2.5-0.5b
    </br>
        ```
        oci://quay.io/redhat-ai-services/modelcar-catalog:qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct
        ```

1. Your deployment will look something like this.

- ***Model deployment name***: Name of the deployed model
- ***Serving runtime***: vLLM NVIDIA GPU ServingRuntime for KServe
- ***Model server size***: You can select whatever size you wish, for this guide I will keep the small size 
- ***Accelerator***: Select NVIDIA GPU
- ***Model route***: Select check box for "Make deployed models available through an external route" this will enable us to send requests to the model endpoint from outside the cluster
- ***Token authentication***: Select check box for "Require token authentication" this makes it so that sending requests to the model endpoint requires a token, which is important for security. You can leave the service account name as default-name.

11. Wait for the model to finish deploy and the status turns green. 
    > Note: It may take up to a few minutes depending on model size.

    ![Image](../img/03/3.1.4.png)
12. In production deployment, you might want to adjust the vllm parameter args to fit your use case, for example increase context length or apply certain quantization. Every use case is different and there is no silver bullet for a config that fits all. 

### 1.3. Query Model Inference Endpoint

Once your model pod is in a running state, you can try querying it in order to test if the endpoint is reachable and the model is returning correctly. The status will have a green tick.

1. Get the URL for the model endpoint, you can get this by selecting internal and external endpoint details from the RHOAI UI within the models tab in your Data Science Project:

    ![Image](../img/04/4.8.png)

2. Get the Authorization Token for your model by selecting the dropdown to the left of your model name. Your Authorization Token is at the bottom under "token authentication" -> "token secret", you can just copy the token directly from the UI

    ![Image](../img/04/4.9.png)

3. Now that you have the URL and Authorization Token, you can try querying the model endpoint. We will try multiple queries.

**You may skip this part if you are not familiar with Terminal or CLI.** Jump ahead to next section, 2.0

#### /v1/models
Let's start with the simplest query, the /v1/models endpoint. This endpoint just returns information about the models being served, we can use it to simply see if the model can accept a request and return with some information. Open up a command window or terminal of your chosing on your computer:

> Note: Remember to change the url and bearer token. the url must end with v1/models.

```shell
curl -k -X GET https://url/v1/models -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN"
```

Running this command should return an output similar to the below output

>{"object":"list","data":[{"id":"qwen3-4b","object":"model","created":1743010793,"owned_by":"vllm","root":"/mnt/models","parent":null,"max_model_len":4096,"permission":[{"id":"modelperm-09f199065a2846ec8bbfabea78f72349","object":"model_permission","created":1743010793,"allow_create_engine":false,"allow_sampling":true,"allow_logprobs":true,"allow_search_indices":false,"allow_view":true,"allow_fine_tuning":false,"organization":"*","group":null,"is_blocking":false}]}]}

#### v1/completions

Now that we know that works, let's test whether the /v1/completions endpoint works. This endpoint takes a text prompt and returns a completed text response. 

```shell
curl -k -X POST https://url/v1/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN" \
    -d '{
        "model": "MODEL_NAME",
        "prompt": "Red Hat is",
        "max_tokens": 7,
        "temperature": 0.7
    }'
```

Running this command should return an output similar to the following:

> {"id":"cmpl-40be2aa235c94f38a3b6161c6b93b59c","object":"text_completion","created":1743011184,"model":"qwen3-4b","choices":[{"index":0,"text":" a company that provides software and services.","logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","stop_reason":null,"prompt_logprobs":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":4,"total_tokens":11,"completion_tokens":7}}

You can see within "text" the completed response "Red Hat is a... a company that provides software and services."

You can change the ***temperature*** of the query. The temperature essentially controls the "randomness" of the model's response. The lower the temperature the more deterministic the response, the higher the temperature the more random/unpredictable the response. So if you set the temperature to 0, it would always return the same output since there would be no randomness. 

**Congratulations! You have now successfully deployed a LLM model on Red Hat Openshift AI using the vLLM ServingRuntime for KServe.**

## 2. Deploy A Workbench To Interact With The LLM
Workbench is a containerized, development environment for data scientists, AI engineers to build, train, test and iterate within the OpenShift AI platform.

### 2.1 AnythingLLM
AnythingLLM is a full-stack workbench that enables you to turn any document, resource, or piece of content into context that any LLM can use as a reference during chatting. This application allows you to pick and choose which LLM or Vector Database you want to use as well as supporting multi-user management and permissions.

#### 2.1.1 AnythingLLM in Red Hat Openshift AI
To get started quickly, we will use a custom workbench - a feature offered by Red Hat Openshift AI to quickly host compatible containerized applications as workbench easily. In your organization, you can BYO workbench as well!
  
  1. Create a new workbench, name it ```AnythingLLM```.
    ![Image](../img/05/5.0.png)

  1. Choose "AnythingLLM" image in the image selection section.

      <!-- Remember to make your storage name unique to avoid name clash.
      
      ![Image](../img/05/5.2.1.png) -->
    
  1. Choose a small size container and skip the accelerator. You do not need a GPU for the application, a GPU is already assigned to your LLM model.

     ![Image](../img/05/5.2.2.png)

  1. Wait for the workbench to start. You should see a green status showing it is running. Click on the name to navigate to AnythingLLM UI.

      ![Image](../img/05/5.3.png)
  1. Click on the Anythingllm hyperlink to go to the workbench application that you have just deployed! 

### 2.2 Connecting AnythingLLM To Our Privately Hosted Model
AnythingLLM is able to consume inference endpoints from multiple AI provider. In this exercise, we will configure it to connect to our privately hosted LLM inference endpoints set up in previous steps.

1. Select OpenAI Compatible API

    ![Image](../img/05/5.4.png)

1. Paste the baseURL from your deployed model(external endpoint) and append **/v1** on it. It will look like this example

    ```https://qwen3-4b.apps.cluster-q2cbm.q2cbm.sandbox1007.opentlc.com/v1```

    >**Note: Use your url. The above is an example.**

1. Paste the token copied from above steps as the API key. The token starts with ey....

    ![Image](../img/05/5.5.png)

1. Use the name of the model you deployed. In this example, I use qwen3-4b as the name of the model. You may key in the name of your model that you want to use. You can refer the model name from the deployed model URL at Red Hat OpenShift AI models tab.

1. Set the context window and max token to 4096.

1. Choose use this for "Just me." and skip password since it is a demo in the next steps. You can skip through the settings that ask for database setup and survey. Give a name to your workspace. 

    ![Image](../img/05/5.6-2.png)

1. When you are done, you will see AnythingLLM main page.

    ![Image](../img/05/5.6-3.png)

1. Navigate to workspace or select "send a chat" to start. If everything is set up properly, you will be greeted with a response from the LLM that you just deployed!

    ![Image](../img/05/5.6.png)

    **You are now an AI engineering expert!**

    In production there are more to it. Things like managing the LLM endpoint lifecycle, logs, versioning, automating CICD deployment and even giving a guardrail are extremely important. Red Hat Openshift AI is your one stop platform to implement all these.

### 3. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) 
RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is an AI framework that combines the strengths of traditional information retrieval systems with generative large language models (LLMs). It allows LLMs to access and reference information outside their training data to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and relevant responses. Essentially, RAG enhances LLMs by enabling them to tap into external knowledge sources, like documents, databases, or even the internet, before generating text.

For the purpose of demonstration, we will use a local vector database - LanceDB.

LanceDB is deployed as part of AnythingLLM. You may explore the settings page of AnythingLLM to provide your own vector database.

### 3.1 RAG with AnythingLLM
You may insert your own pdf, csv or any digestible format for RAG. In this guide, we will step up a notch to scrape website and use its data as RAG. We will use built-in scraper from AnythingLLM, after getting the data, it will chunk it and store in the vector database LanceDB for retrieval.

1. We first ask a question and capture the default response. We'll see the LLM gave us a generic response.
   > Ask: How much can I claim from a car accident?
   <!-- ![Image](../img/05/5.7.png) -->
   
   We can see the response is short and very generic.

#### Option 1 : Upload your own data (PDF)
2. Now lets implement RAG by attaching a pdf ([rag-demo-2.pdf](../rag-demo-2.pdf)). Click on the upload button beside your user workspace.
    ![Image](../img/05/5.7.1-2.png)
3. Upload the pdf rag-demo-2.pdf.
    ![Image](../img/05/5.7.1.png)
4. After that, move it to the workspace and click Save and Embed.
    ![Image](../img/05/5.7.2.png)
5. Now ask the same question. We can see the answer after RAG is more detailed with reference to the data we uploaded.
    ![Image](../img/05/5.7.3.png)
    >Note: You can verify this by expanding the show citation.

6. You can ask more advanced question like 
    > Ask: My car is stolen, I see glasses on the floor, how much can I claim? Additionally, while I pick up my favourite labubu doll thrown out by the thief, I slipped and broke my ankle. How much in total I can claim?
#### Option 2 : Scrapping a website

6. Now let's try another way to implement RAG by scraping a website. The website has a section which has a better answer to our previous question.
7. Instead of uploading a document, select Data Connector and click bulk link scraper.
    ![Image](../img/05/5.8.png)
8. Input the link, set the depth to 1 and click Submit.
   > https://www.crn.com/news/ai/2025/red-hat-ai-3-promises-partners-more-ways-to-scale-workloads-for-customers
9. Web scraping will take some time especially with the depth set to a higher value. If you are an admin, you can navigate to the anythingllm pod and see the process of scraping, chunking and embedding.
10. Once this step is done, you will see the data available. Move it to the workspace, save and embed.
    ![Image](../img/05/5.7.4.png)
11. After that, ask the question ***What is Red Hat's AI?***
and you can see the answer is much more detailed and with reference to the scraped website compared to when you have not provide it a data source.

12. In your organization, you can extend this to scrape internal knowledge bases, git repository, configuration playbooks for example.

13. Behind the scenes, AnythingLLM scraped the website, chunked it and embedded it into the workspace. 
    ![Image](../img/05/5.7.5.png)
14. To see this, go to OpenShift console and select administrator view, click in your project pods, and look for the log section.
    ![Image](../img/07/7.0.1.png) </br>
    ![Image](../img/05/5.7.6.png) </br>
    ![Image](../img/05/5.7.7.png) </br>
    ![Image](../img/05/5.7.8.png) </br>
    ![Image](../img/05/5.7.9.png)

## 4.0 Agentic AI & MCP Server

Prerequisite: The following section requires you to use Terminal or CLI commands. We will deploy llama-stack, an open-sourced developer framework and library by Meta for building agentic AI. 

1. Go to your OpenShift AI cluster and select the app icon to go to console. 

    ![Image](../img/07/7.0.1.png)
1. From the console, click the CLI icon and start a terminal session.
    ![Image](../img/07/7.0.2.png)
1. Git clone this repository
    ![Image](../img/07/7.0.3.png)
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/cbtham/rhoai-genai-workshop.git && cd rhoai-genai-workshop
    ```
1. Now, let's proceed on.

### 4.1 Deploying Llama Stack and MCP Server
Llama Stack is a developer framework for building generative AI applications — are set up and connected to create a production-ready environment across various environments like on-prem, air-gapped or the cloud.

We will need a few components:-

- **Llama-stack Kubernetes Server Operator** <br>
We will be using [llama-stack-k8s-operator](https://github.com/llamastack/llama-stack-k8s-operator). This server operator will orchestrate and automate Llama Stack deployment(servers, resource management, deployment in underlying clsuter).

- **Llama-stack configuration** <br>
Llama Stack configuration, configmap.yaml defines various components like models, RAG providers, inference engines, and other tools are used to build and deploy the AI application. Llama Stack also provides a unified API layer, allowing developers to switch providers for different components without changing core application code.

- **An MCP server** <br>
Model Context Protocol, MCP is an open standard for AI agents and LLMs to connect with external data sources, tools, and services. Like USB-C port for AI, it standardizes communication, allowing LLM-powered agents to access real-world information and functionality beyond their training data.

1. To install llama-stack, we will configure it with your configuration. For this step, you will need to provide details from earlier steps:

    ```shell
    export MODEL_NAME="qwen3-4b" # Your LLM Model
    ```
    ```shell
    export MODEL_NAMESPACE="userX" # Your datascience project name, i.e user50, workshop-test
    ```
    ```shell
    export LLM_MODEL_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN" # Your LLM Model token
    ```
    ```shell
    export LLM_MODEL_URL="https://${MODEL_NAME}-predictor.${MODEL_NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local:8443/v1"
    ```
    ![Image](../img/07/7.0.6.png)

    After that, run the following commands. Remember to change out your namespace!!

    ```shell
    perl -pe 's/\$\{([^}]+)\}/$ENV{$1}/g' obs/llama-stack/configmap.yaml | oc apply -f - -n <YOUR_PROJECT_NAMESPACE>
    ```
    and 
    ```shell
    oc apply -f obs/llama-stack/llama-stack-server.yaml -n <YOUR_PROJECT_NAMESPACE>
    ```
    >The first command deploys configmap, the second command deploys the server.

1. Next we will deploy an mcp server. The MCP server can be any services like Spotify, Uber, Datadog, GitHub, Elastic. You may also build your own MCP server as well. In this example, we will deploy an Openshift MCP server.

    ```shell
    oc apply -f obs/llama-stack/openshift-mcp.yaml -n <YOUR_PROJECT_NAMESPACE>
    ```
    ![Image](../img/07/7.0.5-1.png)

1. Ensure that no errors from llama-stack and mcp server.
    ```shell
    oc get pods -n <YOUR_PROJECT_NAMESPACE>
    ```
1. Add the configuration of MCP server to AnythingLLM
    > Change the YOUR-PROJECT-NAMESPACE to your namespace!

    ```shell
    export MODEL_NAMESPACE="YOUR-PROJECT-NAMESPACE"
    ```
    
    ```shell
    perl -pe 's/\$\{([^}]+)\}/$ENV{$1}/g' obs/experimental/anythingllm-mcp-config/anythingllm_mcp_servers.json > /tmp/anythingllm_mcp_servers.json && oc cp /tmp/anythingllm_mcp_servers.json anythingllm-0:/app/server/storage/plugins/anythingllm_mcp_servers.json -c anythingllm
    ```

### 4.2 Giving your LLM the power to call tools and use MCP
To do this, we will need to go back to OpenShift AI portal. We will need to modify the deployment.
1. In your datascience project **Models** tab, select the LLM that you have deployed and choose edit. 
    ![Image](../img/07/7.1.png)
1. Scroll down to vLLM arguments. We will need to enable a few flags to allow tool calling.
    
    ```
    --enable-auto-tool-choice
    --tool-call-parser hermes
    ```
    >Note: Qwen3 models use hermes parser. If you are using other LLM models, you may need to modify the parser. Check the foundation model provider docs for more information.

    ![Image](../img/07/7.0.7.png)
1. When the LLM model finish re-deploy, we will be able to test. It will take 5 - 10 minutes depending on your model size!

### 4.3 Test and interact with your LLM model with tool call capability

#### AnythingLLM

1. Go to AnythingLLM settings
    ![Image](../img/07/7.2.7.png)
1. Go to AI Providers > LLM and change the context length to 8192 as tool calling to MCP will consume a lot more token.
    ![Image](../img/07/7.0.8.png)
1. Go to Agent skills, scroll down to MCP servers and check if you can see the OpenShift MCP server.
    ![Image](../img/07/7.0.9.png)
    > Hit refresh if you dont see the MCP. If it still does not show up, run the commands in section 7.1 step 4 again
1. The Openshift MCP Server looks like this.
    ![Image](../img/07/7.0.10.png)
1. To test, go to chat or agent chat. Ensure to type in @agent before your question.
    ![Image](../img/07/7.0.11.png)
    ![Image](../img/07/7.0.12.png)

> Your MCP server currently can only access it's own namespace. </br></br>
> To implement cluster wide read-only acccess, apply the following:
</br></br>
> ONLY Admin can do this. If you are joining a workshop, skip this as your admin might have already done this for you.
```shell
oc apply -f obs/experimental/openshift-mcp/cluster-read-serviceaccount.yaml
```

#### OPTIONAL: Deploy Llama-stack Playground To Test MCP
In any organization, you may have developers that would like to build and try on other tools, library or frameworks. The section below showcases llama-stack playground, which have a more robust debugging and logging interfaces. 

To deploy llama-stack playground, follow on. The playground is a streamlit based UI to test the LLM model with options to enable capabilities on demand.

1. In your openshift terminal CLI, run 
    ```shell
    export MODEL_NAME="qwen3-4b" # Your LLM Model
    ```
    ```shell
    export MODEL_NAMESPACE="admin-workshop" # Your datascience project name, i.e user50, workshop-test
    ```
    ```shell
    export LLM_MODEL_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN" # Your LLM Model token
    ```
    ```shell
    export LLM_MODEL_URL="https://${MODEL_NAME}-predictor.${MODEL_NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local:8443/v1"
    ```
    ```shell
    oc apply -f obs/llama-stack/playground.yaml -n <YOUR_PROJECT_NAMESPACE>
    ```
1. Ensure that no errors and all the pods are running.
    ```shell
    oc get pods -n <YOUR_PROJECT_NAMESPACE>
    ```
1. Next we will get the route URL to the playground UI.

    ```
    oc get route llama-stack-playground -o jsonpath='https://{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
    ```
4. Open a new tab in your browser and visit the URL to access the playground UI.
</br></br>Ensure to select **agent-based** and **openshift MCP** on the right panel.
    ![Image](../img/07/7.2.1.png)

    Ask *How many pods are there in YOUR-PROJECT-NAMESPACE namespace?*
        ![Image](../img/07/7.2.2.png)

## 5.0. Setting up Observability Stack & Collecting Metrics

The following section requires you run code in a Terminal. You can run this directly on Red Hat Openshift console or run this through your local terminal connected to the openshift cluster. 

In your terminal or Openshift CLI, run this
![Image](../img/06/6.0.1.png)
```shell
git clone https://github.com/cbtham/rhoai-genai-workshop.git && cd rhoai-genai-workshop
```

### 5.1 Prometheus 

Prometheus is used to aggregate logs. Prometheus is installed by default with OpenShift. However, the default monitoring stack only collects metrics related to core OpenShift platform components. Therefore we need to enable User Workload Monitoring in order to collect metrics from the model we have deployed. More about configuring Prometheus in documentation - [Enable monitoring for user-defined projects](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.8/html/monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects#enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects_enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects) 

Your administrator, in this case the workshop facilitator has already enabled monitoring and shared the token with you via RBAC. By default, you will not have access to the cluster metrics.

### 5.2 Grafana

#### 5.2.1 [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/kubernetes/) is use for dashboarding. It will be used to display key metrices from the logs collected.

1. Deploy grafana, service, and route.
> Be sure to use your project name.
```
oc apply -f obs/grafana-user-setup.yaml -n YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```
2. Get the Grafana route URL:

```
oc get route grafana -o jsonpath='https://{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
```
> Grafana takes a while to deploy. Do wait a few minutes.
3. To check status, run
```
oc get pods -n YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```


#### 5.2.2 Adding Data Source to Grafana

1. Get the Secret Token

    This is the part where the workshop admin have enabled RBAC and shared the token with you so you can use it to set up Grafana, accessing the logs.

    ```
    export PROMETHEUS_TOKEN=$(oc get secret prometheus-token \
    -n admin-workshop \
    -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d)
    ```

2. Add Data Source in Grafana UI

    Navigate to data sources -> add data source

    ![Image](../img/06/5.1.png)

    ![Image](../img/06/5.2.png)

    Select Prometheus as the data source, then fill in the following values:
    - ***Prometheus Server URL***: https://thanos-querier.openshift-monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9091
    - ***Skip TLS certificate Validation***: Check this box 
    - ***HTTP headers***:
        - Header: *Authorization*
        - Value: *Get from running the command below. Copy entire thing.*
    ```
    echo "Bearer $PROMETHEUS_TOKEN"
    ```
    Copy starting from Bearer
    </br>

    ![Image](../img/06/5.2-10.png)
    </br></br></br>

    ![Image](../img/05/5.2-1.png)

    Once the above is filled out, scroll all the way down and hit Save & test button. You should then see the following:

    ![Image](../img/06/5.3.png)

### 5.3 Importing vLLM Dashboard

The vLLM dashboard that is used by Emerging Tech and Red Hat Research can be found here: https://github.com/redhat-et/ai-observability/blob/main/vllm-dashboards/vllm-grafana-openshift.json. This dashboard is based on the upstream vLLM dashboard.

### Model pod automatically terminated (Workaround)

Post deploying your model, after some time the pod for the model may terminate. You have to manually go into the console and spin it back up to 1. After this, the model should not terminate again and the model pod should successfully be created. This is a current bug that is caused by large models being deployed. We believe the issue may be caused because the model is of a size that it takes a while to get it in place on the node or into the cluster that it isn't given a proper enough amount of breathing room to actually allow it to start up. This bug is currently in the backlog of things to fix. So for now with bigger models like granite, you will have to manually spin the pod back up.

After some minutes you can see my pod was terminated the deployment scaled to 0. I will just manually scale it back to 1 in the UI, or I can run the following command from the cli:

```
oc scale deployment/[deployment_name] --replicas=1 -n [namespace] --as system:admin
```

For me this looks like

```
oc scale deployment/demo-granite-predictor-00001-deployment --replicas=1 -n sandbox --as system:admin
```

After this it will take some time for the model pod to spin back up.
